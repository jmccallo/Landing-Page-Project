## Description

The Landing Page Project is a simple web page designed to showcase the dynamic manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a foundation for creating single-page websites with multiple sections. As users scroll through the page, the navigation menu is dynamically updated to highlight the currently viewed section.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the landing page.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file that provides styling for the landing page.
- `js/app.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for creating the navigation menu, implementing scrolling functionality, and highlighting the active section.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can simply download or clone the repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jmccallo/landing-page-project.git
```

## Usage

To interact with the Landing Page:

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Scroll through the page, and you will notice that the navigation menu is dynamically updated to highlight the active section.
- Click on any of the navigation links, and the page will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.
